# BetterGrapher
Helps in making graphs for practicing graph theory or testing graph theory algorithms easier 
through the use of a GUI

## Instructions
  1. **Dependencies**
      * npm
      * flask
  2. **Procedure**
      * Clone the repo
      * Go to the folder *BetterGrapher/my-app/*
      * start the static server as *npm start*
      * Go to the folder *BetterGrapher/server/*
      * start the python server as *python3 server.py*
      * create the graph using the GUI on chrome
      * click on the *export* button
  3. **Language Support**
      * Currently the app supports three languages Python3, Java and C++
      * You can write your programs in the */BetterGrapher/my-app/src/workspace* folder
      * for Python3 write the following to get the graph
        ```python
          from adapters.GraphAdapter import graph
        ```
        This should make the adjacency list version of the graph available through graph
